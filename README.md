# My-HackBio-Internship-Task
My name is Babatunde Bamidele Richard,
a faculty member of a University in Nigeria having my primary specialization in Anatomy
with my secondary specialization in Neuroscience and my subspecialty in Neurodegenrative disaeses.

I love to carve a niche for myself in Bioinformatics
especially in drug development to enhance my research.

I am presently having my Bioinformatics internship at HackBio which is going to run for 5weeks
with the first week characterised already with different tasks,
I am looking forward to learning a lot from the internship program
and to form collaboration with other scientists present.
